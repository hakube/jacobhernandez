I’m a software developer, programmer and a digital marketing specialist. I’m currently working in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also a father (soon-to-be), a gamer, a food and travel enthusiast and does a bunch of other things to. I’m mainly interested in computers and technology (we can grab a couple of beers and talk about all thos stuff all night)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking of starting a personal blog a long time ago but got too lazy to go with it. Life is starting to be interesting now and realized that maybe now is the time to document everything in my life through a personal blog. I love reading blogs so I started to create mine (and I kinda hate social media)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My blog will be about all the things that I like (software dev, programming, marketing, sports, politics, food and travel). This can get a little personal too (except dramas lol).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ll enjoy whatever I write here and I hope to write about a lot of stuff for a really long time.&lt;/p&gt;
